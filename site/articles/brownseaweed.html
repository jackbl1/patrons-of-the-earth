    <h1>Brown Seaweed: The Climate's Favorite Superfood</h1>
    <br />
    Brown Seaweed, currently just a minor inconvenience on your everyday beach
    walk, has the potential to be a major player in the fight against climate
    change. Not just major player: this food could be the holy grail of a
    climate friendly diet. Brown seaweed grows up to 50cm per day, one of the
    fastest-growing plants in the world, and so removes carbon from the
    environment at an unparalleled rate. Brown seaweed also offers an impressive
    array of health benefits. For the purpose of avoiding such an unappealing
    name for such an appealing dietary staple, I will be referring to brown
    seaweed by a nickname that I just came up with on the spot,
    <i>Ocean Lettuce</i>.<br /><br />
    It’s widely known that the meat industry is one of the most damaging
    industries on the environment. On top of that, farms for other food products
    have significant environmental impacts as well. Take almonds for example. It
    takes approximately 15 gallons of water to produce just 16 almonds.[1]
    Taking into account the energy usage in producing and distributing that much
    clean water, on top of the land and energy usage in the farming, almonds
    have a nontrivial impact on the environment.<br /><br />
    Enter
    <i>Ocean Lettuce</i>. Ocean lettuce comes in two varieties, Fucus
    vesiculosus (also known as bladderwrack) and Laminaria japonica. Both are
    carbon negative crops, meaning carbon dioxide is removed from the
    environment when the whole farming process is said and done, and both can
    grow easily in sectioned areas of natural bodies of water. You can even grow
    seaweed in your own house! <br /><br />
    Now, let’s talk diet. Just because something is easy to grow doesn’t mean
    that it is easy to eat. Why would I eat something that looks like the trail
    a slug leaves behind after sliming its way across my window. Well, it’s
    actually great for you. Brown seaweed has been seen to enhance immune
    response, enable weight loss, and improve gut microbiome in rats.[2] This
    food contains a healthy amount of carbohydrates, dietary fibers, and
    prebiotics. Put some ocean lettuce on your burger (preferably with an
    impossible meat patty), make a seaweed salad, blend seaweed into your salad
    dressing, toss sauteed seaweed into your omelette, bake your seaweed into
    seaweed chips. The opportunities are endless. <br /><br />
    Thank you for reading my first article, I hope this piqued your curiosity
    regarding environmentally friendly diets. I will be publishing many more
    articles in the future. The goal of this project is to educate myself about
    climate change while also producing content that can help educate
    readers.<br /><br />
